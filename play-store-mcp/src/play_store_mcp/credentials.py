"""Shared service-account credential loading for every Google API client.

Each client authenticates with the same service account but a different OAuth
scope, and every one of them used to re-implement the "is this JSON content or
a file path?" resolution. The copies drifted: only ``PlayStoreClient`` accepted
a path in ``GOOGLE_PLAY_STORE_CREDENTIALS``, while the others either ignored
the variable or fed the path straight to ``json.loads``. This module is the one
implementation they all share.

Nothing here logs. Credential material must never reach a log record, and the
callers wrap failures in ``PlayStoreClientError`` whose message carries only
the API label and the underlying library's complaint (missing field names, bad
PEM padding) — never the key itself.
